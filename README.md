## Description
This is my first JavaScript project, the app is basically a counter that can be used to keep tracks of points.

As school assignment one of the requirement was to build the counter buttons with JavaScript. 
I decided to build the whole page content with JavaScript since I like that it does it with a single function.  

If you want to fork the project for a personal usage, you can remove the [code](assets/js/script.js#L84-L94) that builds the page content automatically and uncomment the body elements in [index.html](index.html#L27-L42).
